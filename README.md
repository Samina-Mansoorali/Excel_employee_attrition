# Insights Deep Dive

After analyzing the data on employee attrition at XYZ Company, several important patterns emerged that help explain why employees are leaving.

**Attrition Overview:** Out of 4,410 employees, 711 have left the company, resulting in a 14% attrition rate. This means that 84% of employees (3,699) are still with XYZ, but the loss of those 711 employees raises concerns.

**Gender Breakdown:** Among those who left, more men (62%) than women (38%) have departed. This difference suggests that men and women may have different reasons for leaving, which could guide us in creating tailored strategies to keep both groups engaged.

**Performance-Based Attrition:** Both high and low performers are leaving, but it’s alarming that a larger number of high performers (588) are among them. Losing our best talent is a serious issue that needs immediate attention.

**Job Roles:** Three job roles stand out with over 100 employees leaving:

**Sales Executives:** 165

**Research Scientists:** 159

**Laboratory Technicians:** 126

This trend suggests there may be issues related to job satisfaction or working conditions in these positions.

**Age Groups:** The age group most likely to leave is between 26 and 35 years old, with 348 departures. In contrast, younger employees aged 18 to 25 had 132 departures. This indicates that early and mid-career employees may be facing challenges that drive them away.

**Education Fields:** Employees with backgrounds in Life Sciences and Medical fields show the highest attrition rates, with 303 and 225 departures, respectively. In contrast, Human Resources had the least attrition, with only 33 employees leaving. This difference could point to varying job satisfaction and career opportunities across different fields.

**Job Satisfaction:** Job satisfaction plays a huge role in attrition. Among those who left:

**28%** were very satisfied with their job

**19%** were satisfied

**31%** were dissatisfied

**22%** were very dissatisfied

More than half of the employees who left were unhappy with their jobs, indicating a clear need for improvement in workplace satisfaction.

**Travel and Distance:** Frequent travel may also contribute to attrition, as 29% of those who left traveled often for work. Most of the employees who departed (501) lived nearby, while fewer lived far or very far from the workplace.

# Recommendations
Based on these insights, here are a few recommendations for XYZ to consider:

 - Retain High Performers by offering growth opportunities, mentorship programs, and rewards for top talent to keep them engaged and motivated. Losing high performers is especially damaging for the company.

- Given the noticeable gap in attrition rates between men and women, it’s important for XYZ to explore the specific reasons each group is leaving. This might involve offering more flexible work conditions or tailored benefits to address their unique concerns.

- Sales Executives, Research Scientists, and Laboratory Technicians have the highest attrition rates. It would be beneficial to look deeper into these roles to identify any issues related to job stress, workload, or growth opportunities that may be causing dissatisfaction. Improving conditions in these roles is likely to reduce attrition.

- Since 53% of employees who left being dissatisfied with their jobs, it’s crucial for XYZ to focus on boosting overall job satisfaction. Regular check-ins, clearer career paths, and open communication can help employees feel more valued and engaged.

- The age group of 26 to 35 years old is leaving at the highest rate. This group may be seeking more career development and work-life balance. Providing opportunities for growth and improving work conditions for these employees can help reduce attrition.

- While commuting distance and frequent travel may not be the main reasons for attrition, offering flexible work arrangements or reducing travel requirements could help retain employees who are considering leaving.
